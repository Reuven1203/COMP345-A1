This repository contains a C++ project for the COMP345 d20 assignment, designed to be compiled and executed with C++17 or later. The project demonstrates the implementation of a solution to one of the specified problems (Part 1, 2, 3, or 4) related to the d20 game system. It includes a driver to compile and execute the code, showcasing the creation and functionality of characters, maps, item containers, or dice as per the project requirements and d20 game rules.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Project Structure}{Project Structure}}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

The project\textquotesingle{}s design and the selection of libraries are documented within the header files, offering insights into the architectural choices and the advantages of chosen libraries.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Game Rules and Implementation}{Game Rules and Implementation}}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
This project adheres to specific d20 game rules across its various components (characters, maps, item containers, and dice). Detailed documentation of these rules and their implementation is embedded within the code files and Doxygen comments. Here is a brief overview\+:\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Abilities Assignment Based on Equipped Items}{Abilities Assignment Based on Equipped Items}}\label{index_autotoc_md7}
Characters have their abilities (e.\+g., Strength, Dexterity) and stats (e.\+g., Armor Class) dynamically adjusted based on the items they equip. Each item type (e.\+g., Helmet, Armor) has specific effects on the character\textquotesingle{}s abilities and stats, determined by enchantment modifiers. For example, equipping a Helmet might increase a character\textquotesingle{}s Intelligence and Wisdom, while a Belt might boost Strength and Constitution. This dynamic adjustment allows for a flexible and strategic approach to character development and gameplay, adhering to the d20 system\textquotesingle{}s rules.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Note}{Note}}\label{index_autotoc_md8}
This project focuses on the coding aspect of software development, aligning with the course\textquotesingle{}s emphasis. External documentation beyond what is provided within the code and this README is discouraged.
